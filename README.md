# New-Python-File
I am just trying to upload a new Program file to Github
I am an Absolute Begeinner on Github with some basic knowledge about PYthon and C++

The file I upload today uis purely Python code and it's basically for calculating the total cost of varities of a flower that a customer reqests from us !
I made this for my own ease.

I will be now regularly uploading something new on Python. :)
